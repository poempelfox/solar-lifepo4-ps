= Solar-LiFePO4 power-supply module

The goal of this project is to build a power-supply
module with a standard 18650 LiFePO4 battery that can
be powered from a small solar panel and will take
care of all the handling of the battery, including
protection, for you.
The battery is put into a battery holder that is
directly on the board.

Essentially, this is trying to build something
very similiar to Waveshares "Solar Power Manager",
just using LiFePO4 instead of the crappy
(volatile, explosive, ...) Li-ion shit.

There will be an input for a 12V solar panel.
There will be a regulated 5V output to which
you can connect your microcontroller-projects.
